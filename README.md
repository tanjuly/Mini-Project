# Mini-Project- Rock Paper Scissors
This is a mini project on Rock Paper Scissors game using Python programming

****Introduction**:**

In this project you’ll learn how to:
- Code your own rock paper scissors game
- Take in user input with input()
- Determine a winner using if elif else conditions
- Play several games in a row using a while loop

**Objective of Project:**

- To learn how to code a game in python using random module

**What is Rock Paper Scissors?**

You may have played rock paper scissors before. Maybe you've played it to decide who gets first choice of players for a team right?
If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players.
Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 
The rules in this game are:
- Rock smashes scissors.
- Paper covers rock.
- Scissors cut paper.

**Working:**

1. We need to import the random module to simulate the computer’s choices.
2. To play several games in a row we add while loop().
3. Ask the user what they would like to choose as an action using input().
4. Use random.choice() to have the computer randomly select between the actions.
5. Using an if elif else conditions, we can compare players choices and determine a winner!
6. Lastly to check if the user wants to play again or not, we add the play again input(yes/no) thus user can play on loop.
7. If the user decides to stop the game, the loop will break() and get terminated.

**Conclusion:**
- Learnt to create rock paper scissors game from scratch using python.
- Know to expand the number of possible actions in the game with minimal effort.
